# Noctave

Noctave is a pitch-shifting plugin designed to add depth, weight, and harmonic transformation to sound. It focuses on octave-based shifting that can range from subtle reinforcement to dark, otherworldly textures.

Noctave is an open-source project built for producers and developers who enjoy reshaping pitch as part of the creative process.

## Features

- Octave-based pitch shifting
- Designed for subtle thickening or dramatic pitch effects

Noctave is not about transparency. It is about transformation.

## Philosophy

Noctave was built around one idea:

Darkness has layers.

Pitch can reinforce a sound or pull it into new territory. Noctave explores the space between clarity and shadow, allowing harmonics to deepen and textures to evolve.

If it feels too clean, layer it.  
If it feels too heavy, pull it back.
